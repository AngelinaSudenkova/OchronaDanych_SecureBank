# Bank Prototyping

As part of my educational journey, I successfully developed a prototype of a banking system using Python-Flask and React. Throughout the course of this project, I acquainted myself with new technologies and explored the security aspects.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Python-Flask
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Redis
  - Pycryptodome

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  
## Requirements

- **Alembic**: Database migration management allowing changes to the database structure without data loss.
- **Bcrypt**: Secure password hashing using the bcrypt algorithm.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web application framework for Python.
- **Flask-Bcrypt**: Flask extension facilitating work with bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Flask-Session**: Flask extension providing user session management.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Flask extension integrating SQLAlchemy ORM for convenient database work.
- **Redis**: Client for interaction with Redis - a popular NoSQL database often used for caching and message queuing.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Foundation for Flask-SQLAlchemy, providing object-relational mapping for databases.
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI toolkit used by Flask to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Pycryptodome**: Implements various cryptographic algorithms, including AES for data encryption.
- **Flask-WTF**: Flask extension simplifying work with web forms and protecting against CSRF attacks.
